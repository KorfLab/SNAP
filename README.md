SNAP Documentation
==================

## Introduction ##

SNAP is a general purpose gene finding program suitable for both eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genomes. SNAP is an acroynm for Semi-HMM-based Nucleic Acid Parser.

## Your favorite genome... ##

If you wish to train SNAP for a new genome, please contact me. Parameter
estimation is not particularly difficult, but the procedure is not well
documented and I have only included the minimum applications here. I've included
the basic strategy at the end of this document.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The software is routinely compiled and tested on Mac OS X. It should compile
fine on any Linux/Unix type operating systems but new compilers sometimes
complain, so please let me know if you have problems.

## Enviroment ##

The ZOE environment variable can be  used by SNAP to find the HMM files. Set
this to the directory containing this file. For example, if you unpackaged the
tar-ball in /usr/local, set the ZOE environment variable to /usr/local/Zoe
    
	setenv ZOE /usr/local/Zoe # csh, tcsh, etc
	export ZOE=/usr/local/Zoe # sh, bash, etc

If you do not use the ZOE environment variable, you can still use
SNAP but you must specify the explict path to the parameter file.

## Compiling ##

Provided you have gcc and make, compiling should be as simple as:

	make

Testing

	./snap HMM/thale DNA/thale.dna.gz
	./snap HMM/worm DNA/worm.dna.gz


PARAMETER ESTIMATION
====================

Sequences must be in FASTA format. It's a good idea if you don't have genes that
are too related to each other.

Gene structures must be in ZFF format. What is ZFF? It is a non-standard format
(ie. nobody uses it but me) that bears resemblence to FASTA and GFF (both true
standards). There are two styles of ZFF, the short format and the long format.
In both cases, the sequence records are separated by a definition line, just
like FASTA. In the short format, there are 4 fields: Label, Begin, End, Group.
The 4th field is optional. Label is a controlled vocabulary (see zoeFeature.h
for a complete list). All exons of a gene (or more appropriately a
transcriptional unit) must share the same unique group name. The strand of the
feature is implied in the coordinates, so if Begin > End, the feature is on the
minus strand. Here's and example of the short format with two sequences, each
containing a single gene on the plus strand:

    >sequence-1
    Einit    201    325   Y73E7A.6
    Eterm   2175   2319   Y73E7A.6
    >sequence-2
    Einit    201    462   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    1803   2031   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    2929   3031   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    3467   3624   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    4185   4406   Y73E7A.7
    Eterm   5103   5280   Y73E7A.7

The long format adds 5 fields between the coordinates and the group: Strand,
Score, 5'-overhang, 3'-overhang, and Frame. Strand is +/-. Score is any floating
point value. 5'- and 3'-overhang are the number of bp of an incomplete codon at
each end of an exon. Frame is the reading frame (0..2 and *not* 1..3). Here's an
example of the long format:

    >Y73E7A.6
    Einit    201    325   +    90   0   2   1   Y73E7A.6
    Eterm   2175   2319   +   295   1   0   2   Y73E7A.6
    >Y73E7A.7
    Einit    201    462   +   263   0   1   1   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    1803   2031   +   379   2   2   0   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    2929   3031   +   236   1   0   0   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    3467   3624   +   152   0   2   0   Y73E7A.7
    Exon    4185   4406   +   225   1   2   2   Y73E7A.7
    Eterm   5103   5280   +    46   1   0   2   Y73E7A.7


TUTORIAL
--------

In this tutorial, we will create SNAP HMM files for 3 different genomes. In the 
`DATA` directory, you will find fasta and gff3 files corresponding to 1 percent 
of the A. thaliana, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster genomes. Let's start by 
creating a directory for training A. thaliana in the main SNAP directory. We'll 
run `gff3_to_zff.pl` to convert the annotation to ZFF.

```
mkdir train_at
cd train_at
../gff3_to_zff.pl ../DATA/at.fa.gz ../DATA/at.gff3.gz > at.zff
```

The next step is to check for errors in the annotation. The training procedure
assumes that genes are _canonical_ in various respects.

+ Coding sequences start with ATG and end in a stop codon
+ Splice sites follow the GT..AG rule
+ Genes are at least 150 bp
+ Exons are at least 6 bp
+ CDS are at least 150 bp
+ Introns are at least 30 bp

Running `fathom -validate` will tell you which genes look ok and which genes 
look suspicious. Let's try one.

```
../fathom -validate at.zff ../DATA/at.fa.gz > at.validate
```

This will produce a bunch of output to STDERR. You will see several WARNING 
lines saying the DNA and annotation don't have the same definition lines. 
That's okay. The ZFF contains only the sequence id from the FASTA file and not 
the whole definition line present in the original FASTA. The last line gives 
some overall stats.

```
463 genes, 463 OK, 40 warnings, 0 errors
```

If you examine the `at.validate` file, you will see warnings for some short 
genes, short exons, non-canonical introns, etc. We won't be using these to 
train SNAP. To split genes into various categories use the `-categorize` 
function of `fathom` and give it a value for how much intergenic sequence you 
want on each side of a gene. For example `fathom -categorize 1000` attempts to 
put 1000 bp of genomic sequence on each side of a gene. However, if two genes 
are close to each other, say only 400 bp apart, they split the intergenic 
sequence and each get 200 bp of intergenic.

```
../fathom -categorize 100 at.zff ../DATA/at.fa.gz
```

This produces several new files:

+ `alt.*` contains genes with alternative splicing
+ `err.*` contains genes with errors
+ `olp.*` contains overlapping genes
+ `uni.*` contains unique genes
+ `wrn.*` contains genes with warnings

`fathom` doesn't want to create training files with alternative splicing. It 
could create a case of overtraining for those specific genes. If you have a lot 
of alternative splicing, you may want to remove all of the isoforms except for 
the main one. `fathom` also doesn't know what to do with overlapping genes 
because it requires genes to have intergenic sequence on either side. These 
tend to be rare. Genes with unusual features or outright errors are separated 
also.


The next step is to export all of the `uni` genes into their plus-stranded 
versions.

```
../fathom -export 100 -plus uni.*
```

This creates 4 new files:

+ `export.aa`  contains the amino acid sequences
+ `export.ann` contains the annotation in ZFF format
+ `export.dna` contains the sequences in FASTA format
+ `export.tx` contains the sequences of the coding sequences

Ideally, all of the proteins in `export.aa` start with `M` and end with `*`. 
Similarly, the `export.tx` files should start with `ATG` and end in a stop 
codon. All of the genes should validate without any reported warnings or 
errors.

```
../fathom -validate export.ann export.dna
```

The next step is to run `forge`, which will create a large number of model 
files.

```
../forge export.ann export.dna
```

Finally, run `hmm-assembler.pl` to glue the various models together to form an 
hmm parameter file. There are several options, but we'll just use the defaults.

```
./hmm-assembler.pl A.thaliana . > at.hmm
```

To verify this works, you can try it on the various fasta files we've used.

```
../snap at.hmm export.dna
../snap at.hmm uni.dna
../snap at.hmm ../DATA/at.fa.gz
```

Now try the same procedures for the C. elegans and D. melanogaster files.
